## Dungeon

Players do not have be at certain places to access dungoen.<br />
They can enter dungeon at anytime and at anywhere.<br />

## Character

For the time being, there will be only one class and few skills for character.<br />
The charcter's design will be fixed, too.<br />
However, in the future, we will try to add customization and more classes with more skills<br />

## Monsters

The monsters that show up will vary based on your lacation.<br />
In the future, we might add monsters that spawn based on weather.<br />

## Base camp

The base camp is what users will see when they start the game.<br />
Character can wander around on the plane.<br />
From base camp, users can enter dungeon.<br />
If possible, there will be camp fire at the center and tent on either side of the plane.<br />
In the future, users will be able to decorate their base camp.<br />
